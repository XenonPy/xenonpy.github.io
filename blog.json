It's general-purpose, which means it's not memory hard, but it works well and has a Python implementation available. It's based on the Threefish block cipher, so it's fairly fast. Overall, I think that Skein is a good choice, but I want to try out experimental alternatives like RadioGatun, Whirlpool or Fugue too.",
